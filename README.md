# Taxolotl: Genome assembly taxonomy summary and assessment tool

This repo is a placeholder for Taxolotl, _coming soon_!

Taxolotl combines MMseqs2 `easy-taxonomy` with GFF parsing to perform taxonomic analysis of a genome assembly (and any subsets given by `taxsubsets=LIST`) using an annotated proteome. Taxonomic assignments are mapped onto genes as well as assembly scaffolds and (if `assembly=FILE` is given) contigs.

Taxolotl is currently in development, but if this sounds interesting to you then get in touch!
